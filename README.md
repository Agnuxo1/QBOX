Francisco Angulo de Lafuente

Abstract
This paper introduces QBOX, a novel neural network architecture inspired by the propagation of light within a three-dimensional cube. QBOX leverages the massive parallelism and energy efficiency of ray tracing on GPUs to achieve high-speed, low-power information processing. The hierarchical design of QBOX, with specialized neurons (Director, Communicators, and level neurons) organized in a Matryoshka doll-like structure, enables scalability and adaptability to various hardware resources. The system utilizes OFDM encoding for data input and output, with the potential for multimodal operation, including audio, video, and text. Furthermore, QBOX incorporates a self-tuning system with evolutionary algorithms (DEAP) and a "Watchdog" program to monitor and optimize the network's performance. We discuss the advantages of QBOX in terms of efficiency, speed, energy consumption, and scalability, along with its potential for physical construction as an optical processor using laser beams.

1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced remarkable advancements in recent decades, largely driven by the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, traditional ANNs implemented on conventional hardware face limitations in processing speed and energy consumption, especially for complex tasks involving large datasets. To overcome these limitations, brain-inspired architectures and paradigms of neuromorphic computing have been explored, promising more efficient and lower-power information processing [1].

This work presents QBOX, a novel three-dimensional ANN architecture inspired by the propagation of light. QBOX harnesses the power of ray tracing on GPUs to emulate the behavior of neurons and their interactions through light signals.

2. QBOX Architecture
QBOX is based on the concept of a three-dimensional cube where each point can host a neuron. The neurons are organized in a hierarchy, similar to a Matryoshka doll, with increasing levels of complexity and specialization (Figure 1).

At the core of the cube lies the Director neuron, responsible for processing information from different layers. Communicator neurons act as bridges between levels, facilitating information transmission through the hierarchy. Finally, level neurons handle the initial processing of information.

2.1. Signal Propagation and Ray Tracing
QBOX emulates the propagation of light signals between neurons using ray tracing, a technique widely employed in computer graphics to generate realistic images [2].

In QBOX, each neuron behaves as a point light source, emitting rays in all directions. The intensity of the emitted signal is modulated based on the neuron's activation state and reflectance.

A pre-calculated distance matrix is used to determine the light propagation paths between neurons. This matrix is calculated using CUDA, allowing us to leverage the parallel processing capability of GPUs.

The following code snippet illustrates the `propagate_light_gpu` function that simulates light propagation in QBOX using CUDA and a spatial grid to optimize neighbor search:


@cuda.jit
def propagate_light_kernel(...):
    # ... (Code to calculate light propagation)

def propagate_light_gpu(neurons, grid, max_distance):
    # ... (Code to initialize arrays on the GPU)

    # ... (Code to execute the CUDA kernel)

    # Update neuron intensities
    for i, neuron in enumerate(neurons):
        if neuron.neuron_type != "Bias":
            neuron.received_intensity += neural_cube_intensity[i].get()
            # ... (Code to limit and quantize intensity)
            neuron.update_activation()
    
2.2. OFDM Encoding
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), a digital modulation technique that enables data transmission over multiple frequency carriers [3], is used for information transmission to and from QBOX. OFDM offers robustness against intersymbol interference and channel dispersion, making it suitable for communication in noisy environments.

2.3. Self-Tuning and Watchdog
QBOX implements a self-tuning system that continuously optimizes the network's global parameters using the DEAP evolutionary algorithm [4]. DEAP explores the parameter space and finds configurations that maximize QBOX's performance for a specific task.

Additionally, QBOX includes a "Watchdog" program that monitors the network's state and takes corrective actions if anomalies are detected.

3. Discussion
QBOX presents several advantages compared to traditional ANNs:

Efficiency: The three-dimensional architecture and use of ray tracing on GPUs enable highly parallel and energy-efficient information processing.
Speed: The light-based signal propagation and parallel processing capability of GPUs lead to significantly faster processing speeds compared to traditional ANNs.
Scalability: QBOX's hierarchical structure allows for easy scaling of the network by adding new layers and neurons, adapting to task complexity and available hardware resources.
Adaptability: The self-tuning system and "Watchdog" program enable QBOX to dynamically adapt to changing conditions and maintain optimal performance.
4. Future Work
Future work will focus on:

Physical Implementation: Exploring the physical construction of QBOX as an optical processor using laser beams for signal propagation.
Applications: Evaluating QBOX's performance on a variety of AI tasks, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.
Scalability: Investigating techniques for scaling QBOX to millions or even billions of neurons.
5. Conclusion
QBOX is a promising neural network architecture that leverages the power of ray tracing on GPUs to achieve efficient, fast, and scalable information processing. Its biologically inspired design, combined with the self-tuning system and "Watchdog" program, make it an adaptable and robust platform for future AI applications.

Chapter 1: Simulating Light Propagation with Ray Tracing in a Three-Dimensional Neural Network
This chapter introduces the concept of ray tracing and its application in simulating light propagation within QBOX, our three-dimensional optical neural network. We will describe how neurons interact through light signals and how ray tracing on GPUs enables parallel and efficient processing of these interactions.

1.1. Ray Tracing: Illuminating the Path
Ray tracing is a rendering technique widely used in computer graphics to generate realistic images. Instead of processing all points in a scene, ray tracing traces the path of light from the camera into the scene, simulating how light interacts with objects along its path.

In QBOX, ray tracing is employed to simulate the propagation of light signals emitted by the neurons. Each neuron acts as a point light source, and its signal propagates through the three-dimensional cube. The intensity of the signal received by a neuron depends on the distance to the emitting neuron, the reflectance of intermediate neurons, and other factors like attenuation.

1.2. Light Interactions in QBOX
In QBOX, light interaction with neurons is simplified to facilitate computation and maintain computational efficiency. Light refraction is not modeled, and reflection is simplified by assuming diffuse reflectance. This means that light is reflected in all directions with the same intensity, regardless of the angle of incidence.

(a) Attenuation:
Light intensity decreases as it propagates through the cube. Attenuation is modeled by a function that depends on the distance between neurons. A commonly used function is the inverse square law:

Intensity = Initial_Intensity / (Distance^2)

Where:

Intensity
is the light intensity at a specific distance.
Initial_Intensity
is the light intensity at the source.
Distance
is the distance from the light source.
(b) Reflection:
When light reaches a neuron, some of it is reflected, and the rest is absorbed. The amount of reflected light is determined by the neuron's reflectance, a value between 0 and 1. A reflectance of 0 means that the neuron absorbs all light, while a reflectance of 1 means that the neuron reflects all light.

(c) Neuron Activation:
The intensity of light received by a neuron determines whether it activates. Each neuron has an opacity threshold. If the received light intensity exceeds this threshold, the neuron activates and emits its own light signal.

1.3. Code Example: Calculating Light Intensity
The following code snippet shows a simplified example of how the light intensity received by a neuron in QBOX is calculated:


import math

def calculate_received_intensity(neuron, neurons, max_distance):
  """
  Calculates the total light intensity received by a neuron.

  Args:
    neuron: The neuron for which the received intensity is calculated.
    neurons: A list of all neurons in the cube.
    max_distance: The maximum distance that light can propagate.

  Returns:
    The total light intensity received

by the neuron.
  """
  received_intensity = 0.0
  for other_neuron in neurons:
    if other_neuron != neuron:
      distance = calculate_distance(neuron.x, neuron.y, neuron.z, other_neuron.x, other_neuron.y, other_neuron.z)
      if distance <= max_distance:
        attenuation = 1 / (distance ** 2)  # Inverse square law
        received_intensity += other_neuron.emission_intensity * other_neuron.reflectance * attenuation
  return received_intensity
    
This code iterates through all the neurons in the cube and calculates the light intensity received by the target neuron. The function considers attenuation and reflectance to determine the final intensity.

1.4. GPUs and Parallel Processing
Ray tracing can be computationally expensive, especially for complex scenes with many objects and light sources. Fortunately, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are ideal for accelerating ray tracing due to their massive parallel processing capabilities.

In QBOX, the simulation of light propagation is performed on the GPU using CUDA, a parallel computing platform from NVIDIA. This allows thousands of processing threads to simultaneously calculate the path of light rays, significantly speeding up the training and execution process of the neural network.

1.5. Conclusion
The combination of ray tracing and GPUs allows QBOX to efficiently simulate the propagation of light within its three-dimensional structure. This bio-inspired computing strategy leverages the parallelism of light and the power of modern GPUs to achieve fast and energy-efficient information processing. In the following chapters, we will explore the QBOX architecture, its components, and its operation in greater detail.

Chapter 2: Communicating with Light: Data Input and Output in QBOX
For a neural network to be useful, it must be able to receive information from the outside world and communicate its results. This chapter explores how QBOX handles data input and output using light signals. While QBOX has the potential to process images directly in the future, this paper focuses on how advanced light signal modulation techniques, such as PAM4 and OFDM, are employed for data communication.

2.1. Data Input Options
QBOX offers flexibility in terms of data input, supporting different modalities:

(a) Images:
In its current version, QBOX does not process images directly. However, in the future, the surface of the cube could be designed as a photosensitive sensor, where each neuron receives light information directly from an image pixel. This would allow for inherently parallel image processing ideal for computer vision tasks.

(b) PAM4:
Pulse Amplitude Modulation 4-Level (PAM4) is a signal modulation technique where four different amplitude levels are used to encode two bits per symbol [1]. This doubles the data rate compared to traditional two-level modulation (NRZ).

Formula Example for PAM4 Encoding:

Amplitude_Level = (2 * Bit_1) + Bit_0
Where:

Amplitude_Level
is the amplitude level of the PAM4 symbol (0, 1, 2, or 3).
Bit_1
and
Bit_0
are the two bits to be encoded.

(c) OFDM:
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital modulation technique that divides a transmission channel into multiple orthogonal frequency subcarriers [2]. Each subcarrier is modulated with a low data rate, increasing robustness against intersymbol interference and channel dispersion.

Formula Example for OFDM Modulation:

S(f) = Œ£[k=0, N-1] X(k) * exp(-j * 2œÄ * k * f * Œît)
Where:

S(f)
is the OFDM signal in the frequency domain.
X(k)
are the data symbols to be transmitted.
N
is the number of subcarriers.
f
is the frequency.
Œît
is the symbol time interval.
(d) Data Packets:
QBOX can also receive information as data packets, similar to how a fiber optic network operates. The packets are modulated into light signals and transmitted through the cube, where receiving neurons decode them.

2.2. Code Example: OFDM Encoding and Decoding

import numpy as np

def ofdm_modulate(data, carrier_count):
  """Modulates data using OFDM."""
  symbols = np.fft.ifft(data, carrier_count)
  return np.concatenate([symbols[-carrier_count // 4:], symbols])

def ofdm_demodulate(signal, carrier_count):
  """Demodulates an OFDM signal."""
  symbols = signal[carrier_count // 4: carrier_count // 4 + carrier_count]
  return np.fft.fft(symbols, carrier_count)
    
This code demonstrates simple functions for modulating and demodulating data using OFDM.

2.3. Data Output
QBOX's output is realized through a dedicated set of "output" neurons. The activation state of these neurons, determined by the received light intensity, is decoded to obtain the final output of the network. The same modulation technique (PAM4, OFDM, or data packets) can be used for both data input and output.

QBOX's ability to communicate through light, using advanced modulation techniques, allows it to handle complex information and operate at high speeds. This approach opens possibilities for a new generation of high-performance, low-power optical neural networks.

Chapter 3: QBOX Data Encoding and Decoding with OFDM
In this chapter, we delve into the use of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for data encoding and decoding in QBOX. OFDM is a digital modulation method that splits data across multiple frequency carriers, making it robust against channel dispersion and interference.

3.1 Overview of OFDM
OFDM is widely used in wireless communications and digital broadcasting due to its efficiency in handling multi-path propagation and high data rates. The key features of OFDM include:

Parallel Data Transmission: Data is transmitted over multiple carriers simultaneously.
Orthogonality: The carriers are orthogonal to each other, minimizing interference.
Robustness: OFDM is resilient to inter-symbol interference and frequency-selective fading.

3.2 Implementing OFDM for QBOX
To integrate OFDM into QBOX, we encode the input data into multiple frequency carriers, which are then transmitted to the neural network. At the output stage, the received signals are decoded back into the original data format.

(a) Encoding Process:
The encoding process involves the following steps:

Data Segmentation: The input data is divided into smaller segments.
Modulation: Each segment is modulated onto a separate carrier frequency.
IFFT: An Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) converts the frequency domain signals to the time domain for transmission.
Cyclic Prefix: A cyclic prefix is added to each signal to mitigate inter-symbol interference.
(b) Decoding Process:
The decoding process reverses the encoding steps:

Removing Cyclic Prefix: The cyclic prefix is removed from the received signals.
FFT: A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) converts the time domain signals back to the frequency domain.
Demodulation: The frequency domain signals are demodulated to recover the original data segments.
Data Reconstruction: The data segments are reassembled into the complete original data.

The following code example demonstrates the encoding and decoding of data using OFDM:

import numpy as np

# Parameters

CP = N // 4  # Length of cyclic prefix
mod_order = 4  # QAM modulation order

# Generate random data
data = np.random.randint(0, mod_order, N)

# Modulate data using QAM
modulated_data = np.array([qam_modulate(bit, mod_order) for bit in data])

# Perform IFFT
time_domain_signal = np.fft.ifft(modulated_data)

# Add cyclic prefix
cyclic_prefix = time_domain_signal[-CP:]
tx_signal = np.concatenate([cyclic_prefix, time_domain_signal])

# Transmission (simulated)
rx_signal = tx_signal  # No noise for simplicity

# Remove cyclic prefix
rx_signal = rx_signal[CP:]

# Perform FFT
received_data = np.fft.fft(rx_signal)

# Demodulate data
demodulated_data = np.array([qam_demodulate(symbol, mod_order) for symbol in received_data])

# Function definitions for QAM modulation and demodulation
def qam_modulate(bit, mod_order):
    # Modulation logic
    pass

def qam_demodulate(symbol, mod_order):
    # Demodulation logic
    pass

# Verify data integrity
assert np.array_equal(data, demodulated_data), "Data mismatch!"
print("Data successfully encoded and decoded using OFDM.")
